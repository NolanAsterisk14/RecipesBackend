# Backend Microservices for Recipe Site

The projects in this repo are configured to be microservice backends, supporting database CRUD operations for a frontend site that I plan to make using Angular.

I have two projects, one using controllers and the other being minimal without controllers which I did for practice purposes. I plan to make the controllers project the main one that I flesh out and use as my backend.

I initially designed both projects to support SQL Server, but switched the controllers project to PostgreSQL to learn how to use a more robust, open-source, and extensible solution for database operations.
